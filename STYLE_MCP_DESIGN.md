# Style MCP Design Document

## Overview
The Style MCP (Modular Control Protocol) is a personal outfit tracking and recommendation system that helps users optimize their wardrobe choices through data-driven insights and AI-powered suggestions.

## Core System Architecture

### 1. Data Input Layer
- **Photo Capture**: High-quality outfit photos with metadata
- **Manual Entry**: Text-based outfit descriptions
- **Context Logging**: Automatic date, weather, location data
- **Import/Export**: Integration with existing photo libraries

### 2. Tagging & Classification System

#### Primary Tags
- **Occasion**: Work, Casual, Formal, Date, Travel, Exercise, Social
- **Season**: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter
- **Style**: Minimalist, Bohemian, Classic, Trendy, Edgy, Romantic
- **Mood**: Confident, Comfortable, Playful, Professional, Relaxed
- **Comfort Level**: 1-10 scale
- **Weather Suitability**: Hot, Warm, Cool, Cold, Rainy, Windy

#### Secondary Tags
- **Color Palette**: Primary and accent colors
- **Formality Level**: Very Casual (1) to Very Formal (10)
- **Effort Level**: Low, Medium, High preparation time
- **Versatility**: How many occasions this works for
- **Garment Types**: Specific clothing items worn

### 3. Rating System

#### Confidence Rating (1-10)
- How confident did you feel wearing this outfit?
- Self-perception and social feedback integration

#### Comfort Rating (1-10)
- Physical comfort throughout the day
- Movement restriction, temperature comfort

#### Success Rating (1-10)
- Did the outfit achieve its intended purpose?
- Received compliments, felt appropriate for occasion

#### Repeat Likelihood (1-10)
- Would you wear this exact combination again?

    weather_factor = get_weather_appropriateness(context.weather)
    occasion_factor = get_occasion_match(context.occasion)
    personal_factor = get_style_alignment(user_profile.preferences)
    success_factor = get_historical_success(outfit_history)
    
    # Combine factors for ranking
    recommendation_score = (
        weather_factor * 0.3 +
        occasion_factor * 0.25 +
        personal_factor * 0.25 +
        success_factor * 0.2
